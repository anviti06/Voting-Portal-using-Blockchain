# Smart Contract For Voting Portal - Blockchain

## General Voting Structure:

Voting is a very important issue which can be beneficial in term of choosing the right leader in an election. A good leader can bring prosperity to a country and also can lead the country in the right direction every time. However, elections are surrounds with ballot forgery, coercion and multiple voting issues. Moreover, while giving votes, a person has to wait in a long queue and it is a very time consuming process. 

## Why use Blockchain for E-Voting? 

Blockchain is a distributed database in which data are shared with the participant of the node and each participant holds the same copy of the data. Blockchain has properties like distributed, pseudonymous, data integrity etc. In the paper, a fully decentralized evoting system based on blockchain technology is proposed.

This protocol utilizes smart contract into the evoting system to deal with security issues, accuracy and voters privacy during the vote. ***The protocol results in a transparent, non editable and independently verifiable procedure that discards all the intended fraudulent activities occurring during the election process by removing the least participation of the third party and enabling voters right during the election. Both transparency and coercion are obtained at the same time.***

### Libraries/Frameworks/Languages Used:
> Solidity (You will need to download solidity compiler as well) - For Writing smart contract

> Mocha - For Generating Test Cases

> Ganache - For using Test Network

> Web3 - Etherium API for Developers

### Commands to be followed to run the files:
```
npm install
node compile.js
npm run test
node deploy.js
```

After this the Smart Contract will be deployed on Blockchain Network.
